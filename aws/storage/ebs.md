# Introduction to EBS:
Definition: EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a scalable, high-performance block storage service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) that is used for storing persistent data, typically attached to EC2 instances (Elastic Compute Cloud).
Purpose: It is designed for data that requires frequent updates, such as operating systems, databases, and application data.

# Types of EBS Volumes:
# Solid-State Drive (SSD)-backed Volumes (General Purpose SSD - gp3, gp2, and Provisioned IOPS SSD - io2):
gp3: Cost-effective, general-purpose SSD volumes suitable for most applications.
io2: High-performance SSD for I/O-intensive applications like databases.
# HDD-backed Volumes (Throughput Optimized HDD - st1 and Cold HDD - sc1):
st1: Ideal for large, sequential workloads like big data processing.
sc1: Suitable for infrequently accessed data, offering lower cost.

# Use Cases:
Databases: EBS is commonly used for relational and NoSQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) where low-latency access to data is required.
File Systems: You can mount EBS volumes as a file system for storing application data and logs.
Backup and Recovery: Use EBS snapshots to back up EC2 instances and restore data if needed.
Big Data: For large data sets that need sequential read/write access, such as in data processing pipelines.
