# Introduction to EFS:
- Definition: EFS (Elastic File System) is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic file storage service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) that can be mounted across multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. It provides shared access to data in a file system format, making it suitable for applications that require a file system interface.
- Purpose: EFS is ideal for workloads that require shared access to data from multiple EC2 instances, such as web servers, content management systems, and big data analytics.

# Comparison with EBS:
- While EBS is great for attaching persistent block storage to a single EC2 instance, EFS is a shared file system that can be mounted to multiple instances, making it a better option for applications needing shared storage across many instances.
- EBS is typically used for single-instance storage (e.g., databases), while EFS is more suitable for use cases requiring shared access to data (e.g., web servers, file sharing).

# Key Features:
- File System Access: EFS allows multiple EC2 instances (including within different Availability Zones) to mount and access the file system concurrently, enabling shared data access across a large number of instances.
- High Availability and Durability: Data is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones within a region, providing high availability and durability (99.99% availability SLA).
- Security: EFS integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control, and data can be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Automatic Scaling: EFS automatically scales to petabytes of storage without manual intervention, making it suitable for growing workloads.
- Integrated with AWS Services: EFS can be integrated with services like AWS Lambda and AWS ECS, making it an ideal storage solution for serverless applications.
